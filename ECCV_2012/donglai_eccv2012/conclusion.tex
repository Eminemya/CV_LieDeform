\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have presented a new method for manifold learning over images. The
method is distinct from previous approaches in that the model
explicitly incorporates a local Lie algebraic representation of
deformations combined with a consistency relation derived from the
parallel transport property. While previous methods consider local
tangent spaces parameterized by a deformation basis, the methods of
which we are aware utilize a hand crafted basis in contrast to the
presented method which learns the basis. This process was enabled by
exploiting the parallel transport property which imposes geometric
consistency across local tangent spaces and effectively leverages the
full training set (rather than local clusters) for learning properties
of the deformation manifold. An efficient coordinate descent algorithm
was presented along with a suggested initialization
procedure. Empirical results demonstrating the utility of the
methodology were presnted for hand written character recognition and
synthesis as well as human face reconstruction.
