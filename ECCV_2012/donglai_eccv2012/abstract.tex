    Many vision problems, such as object recognition and image
    synthesis, are greatly impacted by deformation of objects.
    In this paper, we develop a deformation model based on
    Lie algebraic analysis. This work aims to provide a
    generative model that explicitly decouples deformation from
    appearance, which is fundamentally different from
    the prior work that focuses on deformation-resilient
    features or metrics.
    %
    Specifically, the deformation group for each object can be
    characterized by a set of Lie algebraic basis. Such basis for
    different objects are related via parallel transport.
    Exploiting the parallel transport relations, we formulate an
    optimization problem, and derive an algorithm that jointly
    estimates the deformation basis for a class of objects, given a
    set of images resulted from the action of the deformations.
    %
    We test the proposed model empirically on both character
    recognition and face synthesis.
